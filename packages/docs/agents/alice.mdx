title: Alice
description: Primary orchestrator agent for planning, delegating, and verifying work
---

import { Card, Columns } from "@mintlify/components"

Alice is a pure orchestrator agent that plans, delegates, and verifies work without implementing anything itself. She dispatches up to 7 Sentinel workers to execute independent tasks concurrently and verifies completion before declaring done.

## Overview

Alice excels at:

- **Planning** - Breaking down complex tasks into atomic, independently verifiable items
- **Delegating** - Spawning up to 7 parallel Sentinel workers to execute tasks
- **Orchestrating** - Managing dependencies and coordinating work across multiple agents
- **Verifying** - Using Keeper agents to validate work completion before proceeding

Alice follows a strict 6-phase workflow (with Phase 4b as a sub-phase) ensuring structured execution:

1. **Phase 0** - Silent mode intake (optional preferences)
2. **Phase 1** - Gather context via explore agents
3. **Phase 2** - Create TODO list
4. **Phase 3** - Execute in parallel (up to 7 Sentinels)
5. **Phase 4** - Keeper verification
6. **Phase 4b** - Code review (inline with Inspect agents)
7. **Phase 5** - Testing
8. **Phase 6** - Commit and push

## Silent Mode

Alice can run in two modes:

<Columns>
  <Column>
    **Interactive Mode** (default) - Alice asks at each decision point - User controls workflow preferences - Best for
    exploratory or custom workflows
  </Column>
  <Column>
    **Silent Mode** - Collect all preferences upfront - Alice runs remaining phases without interruption - Ideal for
    automated or scripted workflows
  </Column>
</Columns>

### Silent Mode Configuration

In silent mode, Alice collects preferences for:

- **Time limit** - Maximum execution time before stopping
- **Audit** - Whether to run code review
- **Audit focus areas** - Security, Performance, Logic, Style, Tests, Docs
- **Auto-fix findings** - Apply audit findings automatically
- **Review rounds** - Max iterations for fix/re-verify cycles
- **Tests** - Integrity+Unit, Integrity only, Unit only, or skip
- **Commit** - No commit, current branch, or new branch
- **Push** - Whether to push to remote after commit

## Parallel Execution

Alice leverages parallel processing throughout:

- **Up to 3 parallel explores** for codebase mapping
- **Up to 7 parallel Sentinels** for task execution
- **Up to 7 parallel Inspect agents** for code review
- **Up to 3 concurrent test agents** for verification

This enables Alice to handle large, complex projects efficiently.

## Phase-by-Phase Workflow

### Phase 0: Silent Mode Intake

Alice optionally asks if you want to run in silent mode. If yes, she collects all preferences upfront. If no, she proceeds to interactive mode.

### Phase 1: Gather Context

Before touching files, Alice may call explore subagents to map relevant code areas. For trivially scoped changes, this step is skipped.

- Single explore for focused changes
- Up to 3 explores for broad changes

### Phase 2: Create TODO List

Alice creates a complete, ordered TODO list with atomic items before any implementation begins.

### Phase 3: Execute (Parallel)

Alice spawns up to 7 Sentinels to execute independent TODO items in parallel:

1. Mark batch items as `in_progress`
2. Spawn Sentinels with full context
3. Wait for all to complete
4. Mark completed items
5. Repeat with next batch

**Critical rule**: Alice never implements tasks herself — every item is delegated to a Sentinel.

### Phase 4: Keeper Verification

After all items complete, Alice calls a Keeper agent to verify the work:

- If incomplete: re-open items and dispatch new Sentinels
- If `ALL CLEAR`: proceed to Phase 4b

### Phase 4b: Code Review (Inline)

In silent mode: check `audit` config; if `no`, skip to Phase 5; if `yes`, run inline review.

In interactive mode: ask the user about review.

If reviewing:

1. Determine focus areas (security, performance, logic, style, tests, docs)
2. Build review plan for modified files
3. Dispatch Inspect agents (up to 7 in parallel)
4. Collect findings and present to user
5. If auto-fixing: dispatch Sentinels to apply findings, then re-verify with Keeper
6. Track review rounds (cap at `REVIEW_MAX_ROUNDS`)

### Phase 5: Testing

Based on preferences, run:

- **Integrity + Unit** - Full verification (recommended)
- **Integrity only** - Lint, type-check, build
- **Unit only** - Unit tests only
- **Skip** - No testing

### Phase 6: Commit and Push

Based on preferences:

- **No commit** - Stop here
- **Current branch** - Commit all changes on current branch
- **New branch** - Create new branch and commit
- After commit: optionally push to remote

## Usage Example

```bash
# Alice with interactive mode (asks at each step)
alice "implement user authentication module with tests and code review"

# Alice with silent mode (all preferences collected upfront)
# After selecting "Yes - collect preferences now", provide all settings
# Alice runs all phases without interruption
```

## Best Practices

<Card icon="lightbulb" title="Break Down Complex Work">
  Alice thrives with large, complex tasks. She'll break them into atomic items, delegate to specialists, verify
  completion, and track progress.
</Card>

<Card icon="users" title="Leverage Parallel Execution">
  Provide independent tasks so Alice can dispatch multiple workers. Dependent tasks will queue automatically.
</Card>

<Card icon="check" title="Trust Verification">
  Let Alice run full verification cycles (Keeper + Review + Tests). This ensures high-quality work.
</Card>

<Card icon="settings" title="Use Silent Mode for Automation">
  For repeated workflows or CI/CD integration, use silent mode with predefined preferences.
</Card>

## Configuration

Alice respects the Pass Over configuration system for bidirectional delegation and can work with Audit agents for automated code review.

See [Pass Over](/features#pass-over) for advanced agent coordination workflows.
