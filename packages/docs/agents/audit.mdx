title: Audit
description: Specialized code review agent for detecting issues across security, performance, logic, style, tests, and documentation

import { Card, Columns } from "@mintlify/components"

Audit is a specialized code review agent with read-only access that analyzes code for quality, security, and best practices. It provides detailed findings grouped by severity and integrates seamlessly with Alice for automated review workflows.

## Overview

Audit excels at:

- **Security review** - Detect vulnerabilities and unsafe patterns
- **Performance analysis** - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- **Logic correctness** - Verify business logic and edge cases
- **Code style** - Enforce consistency and best practices
- **Test coverage** - Identify untested code paths
- **Documentation** - Check for missing or incorrect docs

## Review Workflow

Audit is typically invoked by Alice during Phase 4b (Code Review):

1. **Focus areas** - Specify which areas to review (security, performance, logic, style, tests, docs)
2. **Scope** - Audit receives list of modified files and context
3. **Analysis** - Audit reviews code and generates findings
4. **Reporting** - Findings grouped by severity: `[critical]` → `[major]` → `[minor]` → `[suggestion]`
5. **Integration** - Alice displays findings and optionally auto-fixes via Sentinels

## Findings & Severity

<Columns>
  <Column>**Critical** - Security vulnerabilities - Data loss risks - Crashes or undefined behavior</Column>
  <Column>**Major** - Performance regressions - Incorrect logic - Missing error handling</Column>
  <Column>**Minor** - Code style violations - Suboptimal patterns - Incomplete documentation</Column>
  <Column>**Suggestion** - Best practice improvements - Refactoring opportunities - Enhancement ideas</Column>
</Columns>

## Focus Areas

When running a code review, specify which focus areas Audit should prioritize:

- **All areas** (recommended) - Comprehensive review across all dimensions
- **Security** - Vulnerabilities, auth, data handling
- **Performance** - Speed, memory, algorithms
- **Logic** - Correctness, edge cases, business rules
- **Style** - Consistency, readability, conventions
- **Tests** - Coverage, edge cases, mocking
- **Docs** - Comments, docstrings, README

## Using Audit with Alice

Alice automatically invokes Audit during code review phases. Configuration examples:

### Silent Mode Configuration

```json
{
  "audit": "yes",
  "audit_focus": ["Security", "Performance", "Logic"],
  "auto_fix": "yes",
  "review_rounds": 3
}
```

### Interactive Mode

Alice prompts you for:

- Whether to run code review
- Which focus areas to prioritize
- Whether to auto-fix findings
- Maximum review-and-fix rounds

## Auto-Fix Workflow

When auto-fix is enabled, Alice:

1. **Collects findings** from Audit
2. **Dispatches Sentinels** to apply fixes (up to 7 in parallel)
3. **Re-verifies** with Keeper agent
4. **Re-reviews** with Audit (next round)
5. **Repeats** until all critical/major findings are fixed or round limit reached

**Review round limit**: Default is 7 rounds (configurable via `REVIEW_MAX_ROUNDS`)

## Example Review Session

<Card>
  User requests: "Implement user auth module with full review" Alice Phase 4b (Code Review): 1. Asks focus areas → User
  selects Security, Logic, Tests 2. Dispatches Audit on modified auth files 3. Audit finds: 1 critical (SQL injection
  risk), 2 major (missing error handling), 3 minor (style) 4. Displays findings to user 5. User confirms auto-fix 6.
  Alice dispatches Sentinels to fix critical and major issues 7. Alice re-verifies with Keeper 8. Alice re-runs Audit
  (round 2) 9. No critical/major findings remain → Phase 5 (Testing)
</Card>

## Best Practices

<Card icon="shield" title="Prioritize Security">
  Always include Security in focus areas for user-facing code, authentication, or data handling.
</Card>

<Card icon="zap" title="Focus by Context">
  For performance-sensitive code, prioritize Performance. For critical business logic, prioritize Logic.
</Card>

<Card icon="rotate-cw" title="Allow Multiple Rounds">
  Enable auto-fix with 2-3 rounds to iteratively improve code quality.
</Card>

<Card icon="eye" title="Review Findings">
  Even with auto-fix, review findings before final commit to ensure fixes align with intent.
</Card>

## Configuration Reference

Audit is configured via the Pass Over system. No additional configuration is needed — just enable code review in Alice.

See [Pass Over](/features#pass-over) for advanced configuration options.
