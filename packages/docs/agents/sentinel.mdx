description: Parallel worker agent for executing independent tasks concurrently

import { Card } from "@mintlify/components"

Sentinel is a parallel worker agent that executes independent tasks concurrently under Alice's orchestration. Up to 7 Sentinels can run simultaneously, enabling large-scale parallel execution.

## Overview

Sentinels excel at:

- **Task execution** - Implement features, fix bugs, refactor code
- **Parallel work** - Run up to 7 tasks concurrently
- **File operations** - Create, modify, delete files
- **Testing** - Run tests and verify implementations
- **Git operations** - Manage commits and branches (delegated to Chores agent)

## How Sentinels Work

Alice delegates work to Sentinels in batches:

1. **Alice** marks TODO items as `in_progress`
2. **Alice** spawns Sentinels (up to 7 per batch)
3. **Each Sentinel** receives full task context and executes independently
4. **Sentinels** complete work and report results
5. **Alice** marks completed items and spawns next batch

### Execution Model

- **Independent tasks** execute in parallel
- **Dependent tasks** automatically queue until dependencies complete
- **Results** are reported back to Alice with status and context
- **Failed tasks** are re-opened by Alice for retry

## Task Delegation

When Alice delegates a task to a Sentinel, it includes:

- Full task description and requirements
- Context from previous phases (gather context, TODO list)
- Modified files and relevant code snippets
- Testing requirements
- Any special instructions

Example task delegated to Sentinel:

```
You are a Sentinel worker. Alice has delegated this task to you:

TASK: Implement user authentication module
REQUIREMENTS:
- Add JWT-based authentication
- Include password hashing with bcrypt
- Add login/logout endpoints
- Include comprehensive tests

CONTEXT:
- Project uses Express.js
- Database is PostgreSQL
- Style guide: [see context]

MODIFIED FILES (from Phase 1 context):
- src/auth/index.ts
- src/auth/jwt.ts
- src/db/schema.ts

Please implement this task. Report your results with:
- Which files you created/modified
- Summary of changes
- Test results
- Any blocking issues
```

## Parallel Execution Best Practices

<Card icon="zap" title="Independent Tasks">
  Break work into independent pieces so Alice can dispatch multiple Sentinels simultaneously. Dependent tasks will
  automatically queue.
</Card>

<Card icon="layers" title="Up to 7 in Parallel">
  Alice batches work in groups of up to 7 Sentinels. Larger projects benefit from this parallelism.
</Card>

<Card icon="check-circle" title="Alice Owns Verification">
  Sentinels report results, but Alice verifies completion via Keeper and Review agents before proceeding.
</Card>

## Integration with Other Agents

- **Alice** → Dispatches tasks to Sentinels (planning & orchestration)
- **Keeper** → Verifies Sentinel work after completion (verification)
- **Audit** → Reviews code produced by Sentinels (quality assurance)
- **Chores** → Handles Git/VCS operations for Sentinels (version control delegation)

## Typical Workflow

```
Alice Phase 3 (Execute):
1. TODO: Implement authentication module
   → Dispatch Sentinel #1
2. TODO: Add database schema
   → Dispatch Sentinel #2
3. TODO: Write integration tests
   → Dispatch Sentinel #3

[All 3 Sentinels run in parallel]

→ Sentinel #1 completes auth module
→ Sentinel #2 completes schema
→ Sentinel #3 completes tests

Alice Phase 4 (Verify):
→ Keeper verifies all changes
→ Reports: ALL CLEAR

Alice Phase 4b (Review):
→ Audit reviews code from all Sentinels
→ Reports findings

[If findings] → Alice dispatches Sentinels to fix
[After fixes] → Keeper re-verifies, Audit re-reviews
```

## Best Practices

- **Batch independent work** for maximum parallelism
- **Trust Alice's orchestration** — she manages dependencies automatically
- **Report clearly** — include file lists, test results, and any blocking issues
- **Handle failures gracefully** — Alice will re-open failed tasks for retry
