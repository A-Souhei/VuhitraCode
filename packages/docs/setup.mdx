## Prerequisites

Before installing OpenCode, make sure you have:

- **Git** — OpenCode uses your repository's `.gitignore` for context and privacy
- **A terminal** — OpenCode runs in your terminal (Linux, macOS, or Windows via WSL)
- **An LLM provider** — at least one API key from a supported provider (see below)

---

## Install OpenCode

Choose the method that fits your setup:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

```bash npm
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

```bash bun
bun install -g opencode-ai
```

</CodeGroup>

Verify the installation:

```bash
opencode --version
```

---

## Configure a provider

OpenCode needs at least one LLM provider to work. Set your API key as an environment variable:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Anthropic (Claude)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

```bash OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

```bash Google Gemini
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=...
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Add your export to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` so it persists across sessions.
</Tip>

OpenCode auto-detects which providers are available based on which keys are set — no config file required for basic use.

---

## First run

Navigate to any project directory and launch OpenCode:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
opencode
```

The TUI opens. Type your first message and press **Enter** to send.

---

## Optional: Ollama for local/private inference

If you want to keep sensitive files (gitignored data) off cloud LLMs, install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and set:

```bash
# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3.2

# Tell OpenCode to use it
export OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2
export OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434  # default, optional
```

With these set, OpenCode registers a `@secret` agent that handles gitignored files entirely on your machine. See the [Privacy](/privacy) page for details.

---

## Choosing a model

On first launch, OpenCode uses your provider's default model. To switch:

- Press `ctrl+p` → **Models** to browse and select interactively
- Or pass `--model` on startup:

```bash
opencode --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
```

---

## Configuration file (optional)

For persistent settings, create `opencode.json` in your project root or home directory:

```json opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "agent": "build"
}
```

Run `opencode config` to see all available options.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="'command not found: opencode' after install">
    The install script adds OpenCode to `~/.opencode/bin`. Make sure that path is in your `PATH`:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.opencode/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    Add it to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) to make it permanent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No models available / API key not detected">
    OpenCode reads keys from the environment. Confirm your key is exported:

    ```bash
    echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    ```

    If empty, export it in your current session or add it to your shell profile.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="TUI doesn't display correctly">
    OpenCode requires a terminal that supports 256 colors and UTF-8. Try a modern terminal emulator (Ghostty, Kitty, iTerm2, Windows Terminal). If running over SSH, make sure `TERM` is set correctly:

    ```bash
    export TERM=xterm-256color
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Running on Windows">
    OpenCode is not natively supported on Windows. Use **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow the Linux install instructions inside your WSL terminal.
  </Accordion>
